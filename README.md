# üì± Level Five: Building Social AR Experiences
Social AR experiences are augmented reality applications that enable multiple users to interact and collaborate in real-time within a shared AR environment. These experiences combine the power of AR technology with social networking capabilities to create a new form of social interaction.

Instagram and Snapchat are examples of social media platforms that have integrated Social AR Experiences into their applications. Both platforms use AR technology to create interactive filters and effects that users can apply to their photos and videos, allowing them to share fun and creative content with their friends and followers.

Instagram's AR effects, also known as "Spark AR effects," can be created using Meta's Spark Studio, a platform that enables developers to build and publish AR experiences for Instagram and Facebook. Instagram users can access these effects through the app's camera feature and apply them to their photos and videos.

Snapchat, on the other hand, has been a pioneer in AR technology, with its lenses and filters being some of the most well-known examples of Social AR Experiences. These AR effects are created using Snapchat's Lens Studio, which allows developers to build custom AR experiences that users can interact with through the app's camera feature.

Overall, Instagram and Snapchat's integration of Social AR Experiences into their platforms has created a new form of social interaction that enables users to engage with each other in fun and immersive ways.
